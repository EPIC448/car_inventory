    phase1
     set up user with Devise functionality
       This include runing all the needed command

     set up admin on user which will be a boolean
     https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Add-an-Admin-Role
     option 2: on the link.
     
     To identify Admin you put any where

     if current_user.admin?
       # do something
    end  

    If the page could potentially not have a current_user set then:
     
     if current_user.try(:admin?)
    # do something
   end

   use code to grant Admin access to current user
   current_user.update_attribute :admin, true
